					<p> We attend milongas, travel to events, take workshops and classes...
						dancing tango has become such a huge part of our lives, and in this complex community, we hardly
						take the time to stop and reflect.
						<br><br>
As women, our experience of tango is unique - we do think, feel and observe differently, uniquely and individually - and have a lot to say!
						<br><br>
This is where we think Tango Queens fits in. We are here to give the women in tango a chance to connect with other women, share their stories and discuss the complex experience of being a woman in tango.
						<br><br>
Unlike other networks, we want to provide educational and thought-leadership style content, as well as some milonga-time. Becoming a part of this group will give you access to our events and content, as well as this big, diverse, beautiful mix of tango women from around the world.</p>

							<h6> Monika Jurkiewicz</h6>
							<p> The "Queen Mother" of Tango Queens<br><br>
I started dancing tango in March 2015, after years of different hobbies and looking for ways to connect. I was always the "glue" in any friendship or professional group, always the organiser, the one who brought people together, but it wasn't until September 2018 when I created the Tango Queens group, that I got to understand what a true "connection to others" meant. I have been inspired by the group's influence on women's lives (as well as my own) every day. After watching the group's evolution and impact, an idea about the Congress started shaping.
And here we are.
In January 2019 I assembled a team of amazing women and together we are working hard to bring you the first Tango Queens Congress. Yes, there will be more ðŸ™‚
I truly hope you will love it.
